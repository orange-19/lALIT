# Model Card for gemma3-1b-summarization-finetuned

This model is a fine-tuned version of [google/gemma-3-1b-it](https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-3-1b-it).
It has been trained using [TRL](https://github.com/huggingface/trl).

## Quick start

```python
from transformers import pipeline

question = "If you had a time machine, but could only go to the past or the future once and never return, which would you choose and why?"
generator = pipeline("text-generation", model="lalit-03/gemma3-1b-summarization-finetuned", device="cuda")
output = generator([{"role": "user", "content": question}], max_new_tokens=128, return_full_text=False)[0]
print(output["generated_text"])
```

## Training procedure

 


This model was trained with SFT.
